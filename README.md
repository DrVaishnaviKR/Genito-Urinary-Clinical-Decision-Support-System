🧠 Project Overview

The Genito-Urinary Clinical Decision Support System (GU-CDSS) is an AI-assisted clinical reasoning tool designed to support healthcare providers in evaluating male and female genito-urinary symptoms.

The system uses:

📚 Validated Indian NACO STI/RTI guidelines

🔀 Rule-based clinical algorithms

🤖 Google Gemini AI for natural-language reasoning

🧾 A structured PDF knowledge bank

It assists frontline clinicians by providing:

✔ Symptom triage
✔ Syndrome classification
✔ Key differentiating signs
✔ First-line management
✔ Referral red-flags
